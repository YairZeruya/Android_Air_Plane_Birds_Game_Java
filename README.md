In this game you control a small airplane as it tries to avoid collisions with the birds. Birds appear randomly on the way and must be dodged quickly to avoid a collision.
You start the game with three hearts, and every collision with a bird  will cause you to lose a life (represented by a heart).
This game was developed for Android using Java and the Android Studio IDE.
Additionally, there is a video file called Game_Video.mp4 located in the project files that provides a visual demonstration of the gameplay.
