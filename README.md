*Airplane Dodger*

This game is called "Airplane Dodger" and it challenges you to control a small airplane and avoid collisions with the birds that appear randomly in your path. The game was developed for Android using Java and the Android Studio IDE.

In this game, you can play in two different modes - button or sensor. In button mode, you can choose between two options: slow and fast. Each mode offers a different level of difficulty and requires quick reflexes to avoid collisions.

The game starts with three hearts, and every collision with a bird will cause you to lose a life (represented by a heart). You must try to dodge the birds quickly to avoid a collision and keep your lives.
As you play, your score will start to increase based on the distance you travel and the coins you collect. Coins also appear randomly on the path and must be collected to increase your score. There are sound effects for background music, crashes, and coin collection to enhance the gaming experience. Left image: Button mode. Right image: Sensor mode (without buttons).

In addition to the main gameplay, there is a record button that takes you to a separate screen where you can view the 10 best records (best scores) achieved since the game was downloaded on your phone. The top half of the screen displays the best records, while the bottom half shows a map that highlights the location of each record. You can tap on a record to view the map and see where it was achieved. When the game is over, the records screen will appear, allowing you to check your score and compare it with your records.

For a better understanding of the gameplay, you can watch the video file called Game_Video.mp4, which provides a visual demonstration of how to play the game.
